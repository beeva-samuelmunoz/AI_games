    "## RL algorithm\n",
    "The implemented algorithm is the [Q-Learning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning#Algorithm), that is able to find the optimal policy $\\pi^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q$ is a fuction that given a state and an action, returns a number that means the *quality*, so the best move for a state is the one that maximizes the expected value of the total reward over all successive steps. In this case, winning the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to implement the function $Q$ is as a matrix ($State \\times Action$). And if the transition probability matrix is not known, then we have to sample from the environment by making the agent to play. This way is posible to calculate $Q$ iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Q^{new} (s_{t},a_{t}) \\leftarrow (1-\\alpha) \\cdot \\underbrace{Q(s_{t},a_{t})}_{\\text{old value}} + \\underbrace{\\alpha}_{\\text{learning rate}} \\cdot  \\overbrace{\\bigg( \\underbrace{r_{t}}_{\\text{reward}} + \\underbrace{\\gamma}_{\\text{discount factor}} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\max_{a}Q(s_{t+1}, a)}_{\\text{estimate of optimal future value}} \\bigg) }^{\\text{learned value}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $r_{t}$ is the reward observed for the current state * $s_t$\n",
    "* $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ is the learning rate, which represents the importance between previous experiences and the current one.\n",
    "* $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$ is the discount factor, which represents the difference in importance between future rewards and present rewards."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "These are the knowledge extracted from the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### On learning efficiency\n",
    "The TicTacToe game is an easy environment for an agent as the number of different states is finite and small in contrast with a real-world problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to overcome the fact that the actual computing power allows brute-force searching strategies thus making the game a solved one, some kind of restrictions have to be set. These constraints delimit a tradeoff between the strength (quality of the actions) of the opponent the agent will have to face and the number of games it is able to play (pairs state-action in the Q function) and enables the comparison of different exploration/learning strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time limited\n",
    "When the time to learn is fixed, having a quick response from the opponent allows to play more games. More games equals more knowledge about the game. This way, a random teacher overpowers the ability to train a RL agent of a minimax (optimal move) teacher. Although this randomly explored knowledge may not be of the best quality, it could be enough to explore all the states and therefore, know all the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Games limited\n",
    "When the limitation is on the number of games to play, having an optimal player as a teacher is better than exploring randomly the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minimax teacher\n",
    "The problem with training against the minimax teacher is that the agent won't be able to learn how to win (strategy) as the minimax algorithm never loses, it wins or forces draws. So, the strategy the agent learns will be conservative as some states have not be explored. It can be seen in the game-limited experiment, the rl-minimax agent performs beter than the rl-rl agent against a minimax player but, between them the rl-rl wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### auto-double learning\n",
    "When the agent trains against itself, it is able to learn as player 1 and player 2 in the same game. This speeds-up the process and allows the agent to selectively (not randomly or optimally) explore the game graph. The performance is good in both cases, time and number-of-games-games constrained, as it is as good or even better than other agents. It generalizes very well. It is like having a teacher with the speed similar to a random one and the quality that matches the optimal one as more games are played.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Double learning can be done because an agent playing as player 1 has a completely different set of states as the same playing as player 2. They are 2 completely different agents.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future experiments\n",
    "Some ideas for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting point\n",
    "It will be very interesting to explore how to embed past experiences and knowledge from the environment into the agent (i.e. human experience) to have a starting point to start the training and avoid a cold start."
